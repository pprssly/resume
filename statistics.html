    <h1>NHMS Survey: One-Third Of Malaysian Teens Are Overweight Or Obese</h1>
      <p> On June 1, Kuala Lumpur reported troubling findings from the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2022, indicating a concerning deterioration in the overall health and lifestyle patterns of Malaysian teenagers.</p>
      <p>The survey highlights an increasing prevalence of obesity, physical inactivity, sedentary behavior, poor dietary choices, and excessive consumption of carbonated soft drinks and fast food among local adolescents aged 13 to 17 years.</p>
      <p>According to the NHMS: Adolescent Health Survey 2022, approximately one in three Malaysian adolescents was classified as overweight or obese last year.</p>
      <p>The survey also brings attention to the fact that an alarming four in five adolescents are physically inactive, with two in three leading predominantly sedentary lifestyles.</p>
      <p>Unhealthy dietary patterns emerged as another area of concern. The NHMS 2022 revealed that four in five adolescents do not consume an adequate amount of fruits and vegetables.</p>
      <p>This nutritional deficiency in their diet can adversely affect their growth, development, and immune system, rendering Malaysian teenagers more susceptible to illnesses and diseases.</p>
      <p>The 2022 survey by the Institute for Public Health (IKU) at the Ministry of Health (MOH) also pointed to a high consumption of carbonated soft drinks among Malaysian adolescents, with one in three individuals drinking these beverages on a daily basis last year.</p>
      <p>The survey further uncovered a distressing dietary habit among adolescents, with one in 10 consuming fast food at least three days a week.</p>
      <p>Frequent consumption of fast food, known for being high in unhealthy fats, sodium, and calories, can lead to various health problems, including obesity, high cholesterol, and an increased risk of chronic diseases.</p>
      <p>The NHMS 2022 involved data collection from June 12 to July 8, 2022, focusing on secondary school students aged 13 to 17.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The NHMS 2022 findings for teenagers closely mirror the results of the NHMS 2019, indicating a troubling consistency in the health landscape.</p>
      <p>The NHMS 2019 had revealed that half of adult Malaysians were classified as overweight or obese, with an overwhelming 95 percent falling short of consuming the recommended daily servings of vegetables, as advocated by MOH's Malaysian Dietary Guidelines, which recommend a minimum of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day.</p>
      <p>These NHMS findings underscore the urgent need to address prevailing nutritional deficiencies and promote healthier eating habits among the population.</p>
