    <p1>Diet</p1><p>Consistently consuming high-calorie foods like fast food, baked goods, and snacks from vending machines can lead to weight gain in children. Weight gain is also associated with the consumption of candies, desserts, and, increasingly, sugary drinks, including fruit juices and sports beverages, according to growing evidence.</p>
    <p1>Lack of exercise</p1><p>Children who engage in limited physical activity are at a higher risk of weight gain due to a lower calorie-burning rate. Excessive time spent in sedentary pursuits, such as watching television or playing video games, further exacerbates this issue. Additionally, television programs frequently showcase advertisements for unhealthy foods, compounding the problem.</p>
    <p1>Family factors</p1><p>Children with a family history of obesity are more prone to weight gain, particularly in settings where high-calorie foods are consistently accessible and there is a lack of emphasis on promoting physical activity.</p>
    <p1>Psychological factors</p1><p>The risk of obesity in children can be heightened by personal, parental, and family stress. Certain children may resort to overeating as a way to cope with issues or manage emotions, such as stress, or to alleviate boredom, a pattern that may be observed in their parents as well.</p>
    <p1>Socioeconomic factors</p1><p>Certain communities face challenges with restricted resources and limited availability of supermarkets, leading residents to opt for non-perishable convenience foods like frozen meals, crackers, and cookies. Additionally, individuals residing in lower-income neighborhoods may lack access to safe spaces for regular exercise.</p>
    <p1>Certain medications</p1><p>Certain prescription medications can elevate the likelihood of obesity. These include drugs such as prednisone, lithium, amitriptyline, paroxetine (Paxil), gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant), and propranolol (Inderal, Hemangeol).</p>
