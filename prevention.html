<h1>To prevent excessive weight gain in your child, consider the following:</h1>

<p1>Lead by example:</p1> <p> Make healthy eating and regular physical activity a family-wide commitment. This way, everyone can benefit without anyone feeling singled out.</p>

<p1>Provide healthy snacks:</p1><p>Keep nutritious snacks readily available. Options include air-popped popcorn without butter, fruits with low-fat yogurt, baby carrots with hummus, or whole-grain cereal with low-fat milk.</p>

<p1>Introduce new foods persistently:</p1> <p>If your child doesn't immediately take to a new food, don't be disheartened. It often takes multiple exposures for a food to be accepted.</p>

<p1>Opt for nonfood rewards:</p1><p> Avoid using candy as a reward for good behavior.</p>

<p1>Ensure sufficient sleep:</p1><p> Make sure your child gets an adequate amount of sleep. Some studies suggest that insufficient sleep may heighten the risk of obesity, as sleep deprivation can lead to hormonal imbalances that increase appetite.</p>
